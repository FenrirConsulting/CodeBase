 I really liked reading about the fielded application instance of load forecasting. The section here
 discussed looking at data surrounding the electrical supply industry to predict future demand for 
 power. This is one of those areas that I think data and modeling the future can have a huge impact 
 on society. 
 
    If we can look into the future and know we are going to have to support a certain amount of 
	persons, and a certain amount of power needs, it helps give us information on what overall
	society power requirements are going to be. That kind of feeds back into the important future
	issue of how we transition to better energy sources as well to fuel that growing need. This also
	kind of impacts how we design our cities and the infastructure needed to support those people 
	alongside the electrical need. For the time and amount of people it is going to impact I think
	that was my most important example of fielded applications from this section of the book.
