      The primary reason is that classification will not require accurate probability estimates , so long
   as the maximum probability is assigned to the correct class in this model. For this to work a number of 
   things to need to be true : all of the attributes need have the same relevance to the classification task.
   Attributes aught to be distinct and without reduntant attribute fields or types. Knowledge of a particular 
   value in a given attribute can not really tell us anything about the value of another attribute. Since knowing 
   the end value or end result of a given attribute can't predict another, than having wrong initial assumptions will
   not make an impact on the overall effectivness of the model.
   
      Put another way, our ability to know the end result of individual attributes is not relevant to the 
	  overall picture of the model being an accurate measurement tool. Seeing the forest instead of the individual
	  trees in order to determine its shape and size.
